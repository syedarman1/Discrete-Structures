# [1] Create a function print_table(name, func, n) that prints a (n+1) x (n+1) table for the function f(i, j)
# where both i and j iterate over 0 through n inclusive.
# Print the name of the table
# Add column headings
# Use Python's just() function to right-justify your columns so your table looks neat.
# Print a blank line after the table

# For example, "Four of a Kind" means four cards of one rank and one card of another rank.

# Then, use this function to compare your calculated answer with the known correct answer
